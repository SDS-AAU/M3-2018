# M3-2018
 Module 3 - Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning
 
 ## Session 1: Introduction to Deep Learning
  * [Rmarkdown Notebook (really pretty)](https://aaudk-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/dsh_id_aau_dk/EZElFlVgaAlBiwdUBJrC6YcBlLlRUAvaa9tJenAcSD8gWg?e=GFqATq): There is a lot of explanation between the functions, nice for reviewing the lecture (best download it and view locally, then the interactive sliders work)
 
 * [Notebook (Kaggle, executable)](https://www.kaggle.com/danielhain/sds-2018-m3-1-introduction-to-deep-learning) 
 
 * [Neural City Classification (Colab, executable)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MHq7vpmDs0CIbKA2GnjexmCRDB06Gx0y) 
 
 * [Neural City Classification (Github hosted ipynb)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SDS-AAU/M3-2018/blob/master/notebooks/Neural_City_Predict.ipynb)

 * [Training word embedding models (Github hosted ipynb with colab link)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SDS-AAU/M3-2018/blob/master/notebooks/training_word2vec_text8.ipynb)
 
 In adittion, please watch that,the best visual explanation of the functionality of neural networks you will EVER see. Its round about 1 hour, but TOTALLY worth your time, promised!
