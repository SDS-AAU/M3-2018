 * [Notebook (Kaggle, executable)](https://www.kaggle.com/danielhain/sds-2018-m3-1-introduction-to-deep-learning) 
 * [Rmarkdown Notebook (really pretty)](https://aaudk-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/dsh_id_aau_dk/EZElFlVgaAlBiwdUBJrC6YcBlLlRUAvaa9tJenAcSD8gWg?e=GFqATq): There is a lot of explanation between the functions, nice for reviewing the lecture (best download it and view locally, then the interactive sliders work)
 
 In adittion, please watch that,the best visual explanation of the functionality of neural networks you will EVER see. Its round about 1 hour, but TOTALLY worth your time, promised!
