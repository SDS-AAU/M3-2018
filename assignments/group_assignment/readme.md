# M3 - Group Assignment

Deep learning is particularly well suited when working with unstructured and complex data types. Neural network architectures are extremely flexible and can be adapted to different types of problems, which in part explains their popularity today.

Your task is to build and use a deep learning architecture to explore a problem setting within your main area of study. If you work in a cross-disciplinary team, you are welcome to work on an appropriate cross-disciplinary problem statement.

## Minimal requirements
- Well documented and referenced problem statement (max. ~1 standard page text)
- Data sourcing and exploration
- Non-neural baseline model(s) incl. reflections on extension/further development
- Deep learning model
    + Overall architecture
    + Training strategy
    + Tuning
- Model inspection (global/local explainability)

## Things to consider


### Provide a well-documented notebook
Some GIFs here and there are fun and acceptable, but please remember, that it is not all fun and games. Documentation means going beyond code-comments: Especially larger groups should be able to deliver elaborate notebooks that describe and explain the project. This includes text as well as informative visualisations.

### Be creative: Mix up your data
Consider drawing from different data sources, incorporating various data types. For instance, one could(but does not have to) mix up numerical, text, relational and image data to classify users of an online social network. Reach out if you have questions about that.

### Look into existing research for inspiration
Consider looking into research papers from conferences such as Social Informatics (Socinfo) and Computational Social Science. Some of the papers will link to GitHub repositories with data and code.
